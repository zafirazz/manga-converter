# manga-converter

Before sleep I was wondering how boring it will be on tomorrow's lecture in uni. And then I though of how can I entartain myself during it (it is impossible to understand lecturer, but they give points for attendance duh)
So my plan was to read manga then. But the problem is that internet in lecture rooms is horrible, so logical thing to do would be install manga as img on mobile phone BUT I hate how it looks on phone.  Then it hit me: KINDLE!
Buttt kindle does not support JPG/PNG. My desire to read manga only on kindle won. Turns out free jpg to pdf converters are limited to 20 images, while i need 40+ avg. Also, I was too lazy to tinker with each folder of a separate chapter.

Wait...I am a cs student. Aaah I should have thought of it before.

#Yeah, this whole text is basically about a very easy dum dum code for converting images. I am bored, I have midterms coming up and this is what i do.
What am I even doing
